<h2>You can either run the exe or run the python script:</h2>
<h3>EXE</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Get it from the download links at the bottom.</li>
    <li>Double clicking it will run the fix on all enabled .ini files present in the same folder as the .exe and any folders insides the current folder...</li>
    <li>You can place the exe in the mods folder and run it to affect all your mods at once, or place it specifically inside a certain broken mod's folder and run it there.</li>
    <li>You can also drag and drop a .ini file into the .exe to run the fix on it no matter where the .exe file is located.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Python Source Code</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Get it from Github <a href="https://github.com/Petrascyll/hsr-scripts/blob/main/hsr-fix/hsr_fix.py">here</a>.</li>
    <li>You must have python installed (and present in your PATH)</li>
    <li>Similarly to the exe: it will run the fix on all enabled mods in the same folder as it and in any children directories.</li>
    <li>Run it by launching CMD or powershell in the same directory as the script, and running "python ./hsr_fix.py"</li>
</ul>

<h3>FAQ:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Windows detects the exe as a virus! Not much I can do. Run the python script if you don't trust it, but read it first. Otherwise whats the point?</li>
    <li>It didn't work! Redownload a fresh copy of the mod that hasn't been tampered with and try again.</li>
    <li>It didn't work!! Make sure the exe/py are in the same directory as the broken mod and that you're starting CMD/Powershell in this directory as well if you're using the python script.</li>
    <li>It didn't work!!! Try swapping characters or teleporting in game.</li>
    <li>It didn't work!!!! Read whatever error the script printed in the logs and post a comment or dm me on discord. My username is _scyll</li>
